This project intends to be an example on how to pack a python module to be
distributed by PyPI or referenced by pip/pipenv as an external module.

```sh
$ pip/pipenv install git+https://github.com/bolzon/pypack.git#egg=pypack
```

Test application that references this module can be found here: https://github.com/bolzon/pypack-test
